            <h3>FastAPI Integrations</h3>
            <p> 
                Using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL. 
                Performing user Authentication and Authorization using JWT along 
                with Google Oauth 2.0, integration with Zoom API for scheduling virtual meetings. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed this project inspired by the need to integrate FastAPI with other technologies
                like PostgreSQL and Google Oauth 2.0
            </p>
            <p>While doing this project I had to learn a lot about authentication using JWT, cookies 
                and sessions. Also, I learned about PostgreSQL and how to integrate it with ORM's like SQLAlchemy.
